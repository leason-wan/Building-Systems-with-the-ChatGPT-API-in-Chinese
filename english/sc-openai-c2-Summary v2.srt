00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Congratulations and thank you for getting to the end of this short course.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,280
As we conclude the course, let's recap the main topics we covered.

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,880
We went over details of how an llm works, including subtleties like the tokenizer

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,000
and why it can't reverse lollipop.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:19,520
We learned methods for evaluating user inputs to ensure the quality and safety

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,920
of the system, processing inputs using both chain of thought reasoning and

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,720
splitting tasks into subtasks with chain prompts and checking outputs

8
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,240
before showing them to users.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,080
We also took a look at methods for evaluating the system over time, so as

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:36,400
to monitor and improve its performance.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,120
Throughout the course, we also discussed the importance of building responsibly

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,560
with these tools, ensuring that the model is safe and provides appropriate

13
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,680
responses that are accurate, relevant, and in the tone you want.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,800
As always, practice is key to mastering these concepts.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
So we hope you'll apply what you've learned in your own projects.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,000
And so that's it.

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,720
There are so many exciting applications that are yet to be built.

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,000
The world needs more people like you building useful applications, and we

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:28,720
look forward to hearing about the amazing things you build.
