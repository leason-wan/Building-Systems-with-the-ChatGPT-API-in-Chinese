00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
In this section, we'll focus on tasks to evaluate inputs, which can be important for ensuring the quality and safety of the system.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
For tasks in which lots of independent sets of instructions are needed to handle different cases,

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
it can be beneficial to first classify the type of query and then use that classification to determine which instructions to use.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This can be achieved by defining fixed categories and hard coding instructions that are relevant for handling tasks in a given category.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For instance, when building a customer service assistant, it might be important to first classify the type of query and then determine which instructions to use based on that classification.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So, for example, you might give different secondary instructions if a user asked to close their account versus if a user asked about a specific product.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So in the first case, you maybe add additional instructions about how to close the account.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
And then in the second case, you might add additional product instructions.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But let's see an example and I think it will make it more clear.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So here we have our system message, which is the instruction for the overall system.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And we're using this delimiter.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And it's limiter is just a way to separate different parts of an instruction or output.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
And it helps the model kind of determine the different sections.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
And so for this example, we'll use the delimiter for hash tags.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And this is a nice delimiter because it's actually represented as one token.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And so here's our system message.

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What we're asking the model.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So you will be provided with customer service queries.

19
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The customer service query will be delimited with these hash tag characters.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Classify each query into a primary category and a secondary category and then provide the output in a JSON format with the keys primary and secondary.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
And so we have our primary categories listed here.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
So billing, technical support, account management or general inquiry.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And then below we have the list of secondary categories.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Unsubscriber upgrade, etc.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And so now let's do an example of a user message.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So for our first user message, we'll use.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The following.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:20,000
So the user messages, I want you to delete my profile and all of my user data.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And then we'll just format this into a messages list with the system message and the user message delimited with these hash tags.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
And let's just take a look and see what we think this might be.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So I want you to delete my profile.

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This kind of looks like account management.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Maybe close account.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
So let's see what the model thinks.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Great.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So the classification from the model is account management as the primary category and then close account as a secondary.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And the nice thing about asking for a structured output like a JSON is that you can then read this easily into some kind of object.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So a dictionary, for example, in Python or something else if you're using a different language.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And then you can use this as the input to a subsequent step.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll show you another example, but also feel free to pause the video now and just try your own user questions and see how the model categorizes them.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
So here's another user message.

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Tell me more about your flat screen TVs.

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And we just have the same messages list response from the model and then we'll just print it.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And here we have our second categorization, which seems correct.

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And so in general, based on the categorization of the customer inquiry, we can now provide a set of more specific instructions to handle the next steps.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:58,000
In this case, we might add kind of additional information about the TVs versus in this case, we might want to give a link to closing the account or something like that.

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
We'll learn more about different ways to process inputs in a later video.

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And in the next video, we'll look at more ways to evaluate inputs and specifically ways to ensure that your users are using the system in a responsible way.
